\paragraph{Requirements:}\

	The virtual hospital simulation will simulate a busy day at the hospital. This will act as a way to test
	and demonstrate our code/project.

\paragraph{Preliminary Study:}\

	The current consideration for implementing the simulation would be a separate program that will run on
	top of our code and it will mimic patients and doctors using the our program.
